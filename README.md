# Final-Project
My final project is a random password generator that requires users to enter password length, number of symbols (symbols are limited to (! @ # $% ^ &amp; * () - + = []} {/,. >)), number of numbers, and whether uppercase letters are required. You can then randomly generate a password. In order to make the whole program more visual, I used Tkinter -- user graphical interface.
